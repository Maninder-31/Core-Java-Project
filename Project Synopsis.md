College Management System (MVC Based CRUD
Application)

1. Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a Java-based College Management System that performs
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MVC architecture. The system manages
student, teacher, and course data through a structured and modular approach. It demonstrates
object-oriented programming concepts and separation of concerns.

2. Modules


• Student Module: Add, View, Update, Delete student records.
• Teacher Module: Add, View, Update, Delete teacher records.
• Course Module: Add, View, Delete course records.

3. Technology Used

• Programming Language: Java
• Architecture Pattern: MVC (Model-View-Controller)
• IDE: Eclipse
• Data Storage: ArrayList (In-memory)
• Version Control: Git & GitHub
• Concepts: OOP, Encapsulation, Collections, Exception Handling

4. Conclusion
The College Management System successfully demonstrates CRUD operations using MVC
architecture in Java. The project follows modular programming principles and maintains separation
between Model, DAO, Controller, and Main application layers. It provides a strong foundation for
future enhancement such as database integration using JDBC.
